        <p>The focus of this project was to explore the famous Gapminder dataset visually using ggplot graphs like the
            one above. I also used the other tidyverse packages like dplyr to manipulate the data in different ways to
            create well formatted data that fits into summary tables.</p>

        <p>This project was based around forecasting methods. I find overall trends, monthly seasonality, and fit ARIMA
            and SARIMA models. I compare the two model’s performance as well as fit. I then forecasted homicides for the
            next 24 months.</p>

        <p>The idea for this assignment was to gain experience and become more comfortable reading and interpreting
            scientific research papers. We also learned the importance of reproducibility and transparency. My group was
            tasked with reproducing the results and models from this paper and reporting on them. I was in charge of the
            modeling as well as the table for the models, both of which are created with the source code I linked. The
            picture above is a replication of the table used in the original paper. Interestingly, we ended up finding a
            small mistake in the paper.</p>

        <p>This was a group project. I handled the random forest model as well as the data cleaning. We each tried a
            model and compared results. The random forest model came out on top based on testing MSE. I had to learn a
            lot about resource allocation to complete this project. The dataset had 180k rows and 10+ possible
            predictors. I quickly found out that I would not be able to easily tune and train the model. The training
            process ended up taking a few days with cross-validation on less than half of the full dataset. I had to
            weigh run time vs accuracy and pick model parameters early on in the training process.</p>

        <p>The setup for this project:<br />
            “There are two tests for influenza strain K9C9. The data collected consists of 10 countries and 100 pairs of
            test results. The more accurate of the tests will be assumed fact. The less accurate test, EZK, is the area
            of
            interest for this project. A Bayesian hierarchical model will be fit and it will be simulated with an MCMC
            algorithm using R/jags.”<br />
            I fit the model, assessed fit, and interpreted the results in the context of a global pandemic.</p>
