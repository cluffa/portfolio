            </p>

            <p>I created this model and python package to be able to track a barbell and get different metrics from a
                video.
                It works using a convolutional neural network with 4 million parameters. It takes a 320x320x3
                image/matrix
                input and outputs a segmentation of the image (aka mask) where each of the two classes has a different
                layer. Ellipses are fit to the largest contours found in each layer of the mask. This is a reliable way
                find
                the center, even if the object is partially out of frame. The average of the two sides is used for the
                metrics. This is a good way to combat some of the distortions due to off-axis movements like rotation.
                The
                plates are always a constant 450 mm, so I was able to scale the units from pixels to meters using the
                dimensions of the ellipses. The position at every time is then used to create two splines, f1(t)=x and
                f2(t)=y. The splines allow for a variable time resolution as well as missing values. The velocity and
                acceleration are derived from the splines. These also go through Savgov filters remove distortions and
                noise.</p>

            <p>The data is a collection of tweets that have been labeled as pertaining to a disaster or not. For
                example,
                one might be about the damage of an earthquake while another is about a sports team. Each tweet has a
                text
                body, keyword, and location. I used a linear support vector machine (SVM) model and tested the model
                with
                combinations of text body, keyword, and location.</p>

                    Notebook</a>. Most of the plotting and data exploration was done in the <a
                    href="https://github.com/cluffa/titanic/blob/master/titanic.ipynb" class="projlink">first version of the notebook</a>
                where I added no features.</p>

            <p>The main goal was to try to predict survivors based on what we know about each passenger. I used
                scikit-learn
                pipelines to make a clear transformation pipeline for the data. This includes encoding, multivariate
                imputing, as well as training. I used a gradient boosting classifier model where hyperparameters were
                optimized by grid search and cross-validation. This notebook was used to submit scores to Kaggle’s
                “Titanic:
                Machine Learning From Disaster” competition. With feature engineering like multivariate imputing and
                matching families, I achieved an accuracy score of 0.801 when submitting. This put me in the top 5% of
                the
                leader board.</p>

            <p>Because I have been learning Julia, I decided to go back to the basics of deep learning by creating a convolutional neural network for the MNIST dataset. This was a great way to learn how to use Julia's deep learning framework (like PyTorch or TF). With a fairly simple model I was able to predict the handwritten digits with 99.5% accuracy.</p>

                used python for scraping. I needed the data to be easily imported into R, so I used R to clean and save
